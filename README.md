# Citibikes

Phenomenons:
	1.	Three time the Male riders as female
	⁃	Males make up the overwhelming majority of riders
	⁃	Why are they so much more?
	⁃	We need more data
	2.	Average Trip Duration by age
	⁃	We would assume that either average trip duration was consistent over age or increase for younger riders
	⁃	The data is sporadic and tends to have large spikes
	⁃	The inconsistency of the data leads us to think the users are lying since there are a lot of elderly taking long trips
	⁃	We need to ask for better data to analyze this
	3.	Time of day rides 
	⁃	Spike in the data at 8pm and 5pm which we would expect
	⁃	Midday flattens out
	⁃	Late evening/early morning has the least amount of rides which is to be expected
	4.	No discernible difference in time of day between gender
	⁃	When analyzing data for gender it doesn’t seem to show there is any difference in when Male and Females start riding
	⁃	To understand why Males ride so much more than Females we need more data and analysis
	5.	Riders end closer to the river in NJ
	⁃	We see riders are ending closer to the river in NJ rather than inland
	⁃	We would assume this is because they are headed back to NY where the population is higher rather than coming from NY to NJ at the end of the day
